## Notes

### Core team participation

* @Ch3LL would like to attend
* Current time clashes with a core team meeting
* Will look to move time, 1hr earlier

### Upstreaming security related changes

* Cloudflare published blog post on [Future-proofing SaltStack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/future-proofing-saltstack/)
* Key part of this was an mTLS based transport that they indicated they wanted to upstream - "We have shared our preliminary results with Salt, and we are working together to add an mTLS-based transport upstream".
* Haven't heard anything further from them
* LinkedIn publish blog post "[Scaling Salt for Remote Execution to support LinkedIn Infra growth](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2023/scaling-salt-for-remote-execution-to-support-linkedin-infra-grow)", which mentions a number of changes they have made, including
  * PKI auth module for salt-api
  * Auth token management
  * Engine for monitoring executions and Salt ACLs
* Should follow up with Cloudflare and LinkedIn to try and work with them to upstream those changes

### 3006.0 release - salt user for salt-master

* Unclear why change was added between last RC and .0 release
* [SEP19](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-enhancement-proposals/blob/master/accepted/0019-master-non-root.md) was accepted some time ago and outlines design for this, but that wasn't used
* Disruption caused by last minute change and problems from that ([#64174](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/64174), [#64193](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64193), [#64219](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64219)) are likely to cause more friction and make implementing other changes from SEP19 more difficult.
* Would be good to understand why change were made when they were and why the SEP wasn't followed.

### Docs

* Docs on [running salt as unprivileged user](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/configuration/nonroot.html) are very outdated and not up to date with 3006.0
* Security/hardening docs are not easy to find, in multiple places and outdated
* @jneel has some time to help with this but will need some assistance on where to start


## Actions

* @barneysowood to finalise new time, get calendar/website updated and announce on slack
* @barneysowood to follow up with Cloudflare and LinkedIn
* @barneysowood to discuss 3006.0/salt user with core team
* @barneysowood to open tickets on required docs updates and co-ordinate with @jneel
