## Notes

### Github private vulnerability reporting

* Raised as possible way to simplify management of vulnerability reporting
* Been investigated before - at that point issues with functionality (esp around private forks)
* @ScriptAutomate to find previous issues [done]
* @barneysowood to investigate and see if it would still be beneficial even without using private forks

### relenv dependencies

* Discussion of how dependencies are tracked for relenv
* @ScriptAutomate would like to see SBOM for relenv and salt builds
* @barneysowood to discuss further with @dwoz

### salt-extenions Github Actions

* Some concerns over permission usage in copier template
* @barneysowood to complete further testing and discuss with maintainers

### Github Actions security for Salt repo

* Discusion of security in GHA for Salt repo
* Scanning with [Zizmor](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor) hasn't revealed any serious issues
* Some minor issues to look at
* Longer term, looking at simplification and reduction in reliance on 3rd party Actions
* @barneysowood to open PR with minor fixes

### Github Issues spam

* Problem recently on [saltstack/pepper](https://github.com/saltstack/pepper) repo
* Some modifications to settings have helped but mainly relying on Github to catch and cleanup
* No good solutions currently

### ACL support for netapi SSE/websocket endpoints

* No support for ACLs on netapi for SSE/websockets currently
* @barneysowood working on possible feature - open PR and discussion when ready
