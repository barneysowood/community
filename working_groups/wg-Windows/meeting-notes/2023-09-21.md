## Agenda
- Welcome
- New & Upcoming Releases
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64925
- Closing of Salt issue backlog
- Community Issues and Discussion

## Discussed Previously
- multi-minion got included in the 3006.2 release
  - Daffyd has been testing and is displaying the double-return issue
  - We need to get that fixed or figured out... or something
  - Daffyd will open an issue depending on his findings
  - Could be linking off the UUID grain
  - Could also try setting the pidfile option in minion config
    - Nope, they have separate locations
- rSync on Windows
  - Looked at the rsync-git package in winrepo
  - Maybe need to use cwrsync instead... less dependencies
- Remove the version from the Display Name in the NSIS/MSI installer
  - The version is already recorded in ``appwiz.cpl`` under version
  - It looks cleaner and makes the state ``pkg.installed`` more clear when
    using ``test=True``

## Today's Discussion
- Windows Beacons
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/52270 (registry beacon)
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/49965 (diskusage)
  - Lea wants to create a beacon for monitoring registry settings
  - Need to find a way to programmatically get the modified date-time for registry keys
  - Can possibly use win32api.RegQueryInfoKey
- PS Module
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/65252
  - the `ps.psaux` function needs to work on Windows
- 3006.3 minion not able to connect to the master
  - There has been a slack user complaining about this issue
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/65105
  - This should be a blocker for the next release
- A basic rundown of how Salt works
  - Salt Execution and State modules
  - Highstates
  - Pillar

## TODO
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
  - Move this to Salt repo as the scripts have been moved there
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
  - Move this to Salt repo as the scripts have been moved there
