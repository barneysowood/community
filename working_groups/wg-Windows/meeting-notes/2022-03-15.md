## Agenda
- Welcome

## Followup
- Community involvement seems to have fallen off in the last 6 months
- /move-config bug
  - Issue created in salt... transferred to salt-windows-nsis
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
- Problems with custom-config
- 32bit salt on 64bit windows
- winrepo:
  - Need to move the tests to a Windows runner so that the `reg.read` commands execute properly
  - Script failures need to make the tests fail (false positive)
  - Add a some jinja parsing checks, perhaps?
- winrepo: salt uninstall
  - Works, but breaks the tests... need to update the way we test
- Added WUA issue to sprint: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61479
- Discussed key-rotation

## Discussed
- Community Involvement
- /move-config bug
- Problems with custom-config
- winrepo url tests:
  - Need to move the tests to a Windows runner so that the `reg.read` commands execute properly
  - Script failures need to make the tests fail (false positive)
  - Add a some jinja parsing checks, perhaps?
  - Jinja failures aren't considered failures.
  - Current tests run on Linux Runners.... need to transition to Windows Runners to expose all windowzy stuff
- winrepo: salt uninstall
  - Works, but breaks the tests... need to update the way we test
  - Need to find the uninstaller based on where salt was installed
- Making Salt work as a standard user
  - permissions and documentation... maybe...
  - Standard user does not have permission to HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Salt Project\Salt
  - Is there a security reason why this is being locked down? I don't think so...

## TODO
- Twangboy: Community Involvement:
  - Bring this up to the Core Team. Has anybody noticed a falling off of interest or involvement?
  - Is this a concern? How do we improve this? How do keep our momentum?
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61789
