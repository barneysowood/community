## Followup
- /move-config bug
  - Issue created in salt... transferred to salt-windows-nsis
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
- Problems with custom-config
- winrepo url tests:
  - Need to move the tests to a Windows runner so that the `reg.read` commands execute properly
  - Script failures need to make the tests fail (false positive)
  - Add some jinja parsing checks, perhaps?
  - Jinja failures aren't considered failures.
  - Current tests run on Linux Runners... need to transition to Windows Runners to expose all windozy stuff
- winrepo: salt uninstall
  - Works, but breaks the tests... need to update the way we test
  - Need to find the uninstaller based on where salt was installed
- Making Salt work as a standard user
  - permissions and documentation... maybe...
  - Standard user does not have permission to HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Salt Project\Salt
  - Is there a security reason why this is being locked down? I don't think so...
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61789

## Discussed
- winrepo url tests:
  - Migrate to Windows Runner
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt-winrepo-ng/blob/master/.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml
  - Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61789
  - Use one of our installers to set up salt
  - Use the python environment from the installer
- salt-minion software definition needs to be fixed
  - It's pointing to ProgramData instead of Program Files
- Making Salt work as a standard user
  - Test giving Non-Admin user permissions to the registry key

## TODO
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
- Twangboy: Discuss removing pycurl from requirements for Windows
  - It's not being used by any other package (linux, darwin, freebsd)
- Dafydd: Work on transitioning the winrepo tests to run on a Windows Runner
  - Migrating to requests from pycurl in the tests
  - Look into implementing the tests as a salt extension
- Twangboy: Test giving Non-Admin user to registry key
