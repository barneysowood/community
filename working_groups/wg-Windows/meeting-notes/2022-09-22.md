## Agenda
- Welcome
- New date/time for Windows Working Group meetings
- Followup Items:
  - TODO Items
- Community Issues and Discussion

## Discussed
- Issue 62479: Done and Merged
- Issue 62734: LGPO Caching
- Issue 62480: win_pkg debug logging
- Issues with WinRepo:
  - Issue with the inability to do Jinja tests because it is a Linux Runner and
    much of the jinja has Windows stuff in it
  - Issue with the 7zip definition where the indentation is wrong, causing only
    the first portion to be validated
  - Issue with the cache location and how to obtain that from salt in the
    definition file. Best to use `config.get root_dir`
  - The solution to all of this is to migrate to a Windows Runner, so we can
    include some Jinja parsing tests

## TODO
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Dafydd: Work on transitioning the winrepo tests to run on a Windows Runner
  - Migrating to requests from pycurl in the tests
  - Look into implementing the tests as a salt extension
- Twangboy: Test giving Non-Admin user to registry key
  - This may be working now... needs further testing
  - Need to be able to start the minion as a standard non-privileged user
