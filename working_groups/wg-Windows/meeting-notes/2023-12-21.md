## Today's Discussion
- Broadcom acquisition and its implications
- Can't restart the minion service from the Task Manger -> Services tab
  - But it works from the services GUI
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/65577
- Slack notifications
  - Slack module looks to be out of date
  - Slack no longer uses an API key
  - Instead, you have a web-hook with a unique URL
  - Looked at using other methods to post to the webhook
  - https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/http.html#execution-module
  - Or just using `cmd.run curl` or something
  - https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/ref/returners/all/salt.returners.slack_webhook_return.html
- Registry Key for the current user
  - Tracking locale of each machine
  - Wanting to get that information from the registry
  - Possibly use multi-minion solution
  - Using Powershell currently
  - The minion service is started under the user context
- How to debug Salt
  - Dafyddj has some suggestions here:
    - https://saltstackcommunity.slack.com/archives/C7U9FLK8S/p1700155002286469
  - salt-call -l debug
- Upgrading Salt to 3006
  - Some of the formulas are not working on 3006
  - They are unstable
- Salt Package Manager (SPM)
  - Need to explore SPM to replace/supplement gitFS
- WinGet -> OneGet -> AnyPackage -> Winrepo
  - Explore adding support for another package manager for software installation
  - It's hard to maintain winrepo... there are very few contributors
  - Chocolatey only knows about packages installed via chocolatey

## TODO
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
  - Move this to Salt repo as the scripts have been moved there
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
  - Move this to Salt repo as the scripts have been moved there
