## Agenda
- Welcome
- Releases
  - 3006.9 (released)
  - 3007.2 (upcoming)

## Discussed Previously
- Community Issues and Discussion
  - win_wua issue. I'll take a look at it.
    https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/66739
  - winrepo versions... tagging winrepo versions
    - Create winrepo packages that are installed with Salt Package Manager (SPM)
    - Publish a JSON file with the contents of the repository on a release
    - Create packages using SPM so people don't have to use Git to use winrepo

## Today's Discussion
- Went through adding a renovate comment on Notepad++ and VLC
  After merge, renovate created a PR with the latest version
- Mark brought up the ability to specify a source in a closed/air-gapped
  environment. We talked about adding some boilerplate code that defaults to
  the original location, but could be changed with a grain or minion config.

## TODO
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Twangboy: archive.repo.saltproject.io
  - I need to find out if this is still used and if we need to archive any of
    our more recent releases
