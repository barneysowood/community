## Attendees

## Agenda
- Welcome
- New & Upcoming Releases
- Community Issues and Discussion

## Discussed Previously
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/64258
- Talked about protecting the salt-minion running under the user context from
  being shut down
  - So the user can't kill the multi-minion running under their target
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/services/protecting-anti-malware-services-?redirectedfrom=MSDN

## Today's Discussion
- multi-minion got included in the 3006.2 release
  - Daffyd has been testing and is displaying the double-return issue
  - We need to get that fixed or figured out... or something
  - Daffyd will open an issue depending on his findings
  - Could be linking off the UUID grain
  - Could also try setting the pidfile option in minion config
    - Nope, they have separate locations
- rSync on Windows
  - Looked at the rsync-git package in winrepo
  - Maybe need to use cwrsync instead... less dependencies
- Remove the version from the Display Name in the NSIS/MSI installer
  - The version is already recorded in ``appwiz.cpl`` under version
  - It looks cleaner and makes the state ``pkg.installed`` more clear when
    using ``test=True``

## TODO
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Twangboy: Issue with winrepo and environments:
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60471
  - winrepo is meant to be a quick and easy way to set it up
  - for more complex configurations, use gitfs
  - Need to provide documentation stating as much ^^^^
