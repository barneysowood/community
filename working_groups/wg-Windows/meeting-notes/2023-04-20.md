## Agenda
- Welcome
- 3006.0 has been released
- Location of the python.exe changed, broke pip states
- Pipeline work
- Salt Bootstrap
- Community Issues and Discussion

## Discussed Previously
- Need the ability to run the debugger ( python.exe -E -s -m pdb salt-minion args )
  - Don't know if the non .exe scripts are being generated
- Looked at some work that Dafydd had done with github actions on salt-winrepo-ng
- Reviewed a pending PR in salt-winrepo-ng
- Twangboy needs to look at running salt-minion as a Non-Admin user

## Today's Discussion
- How far back should bootstrap support?
  - 2 Major releases prior to supported
- Talked about the release cycle
- Looked at the layout of the salt/py3/windows
  - Still some work to be done here
- Issue with winrepo and environments:
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/60471
  - Maybe Thomas Phipps can give some more guidance

## TODO
Future:
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/53969
  - Let's talk about this in the next core meeting or on slack with the team
  - Bring it up in Open Hour
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Twangboy: Test giving Non-Admin user to registry key
  - This may be working now... needs further testing
  - Need to be able to start the minion as a standard non-privileged user
  - Document how to do it
  - Provide a script to automate creating the service, setting the config, like
    macOS (salt-config.sh)
