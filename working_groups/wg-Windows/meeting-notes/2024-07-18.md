## Discussed Previously
- Winrepo Renovate
  - There is now a pinned issue for manually updating versions in the package
    definitions. You just check the box in the issue and wait a few seconds.
    Renovate will pick it up and update everything that it has defined in its
    `renovate.json5` file.
  - We need to create some metadata comments in the sls files we want renovate
    to update
- archive.repo.saltproject.io
  - I need to find out if this is still used and if we need to archive any of
    our more recent releases
- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/65265
  - This is a pretty active issue regarding connectivity issues. It has gotten
    worse in 3007. I'm going to bring it to dwoz's attention.

## Today's Discussion
- Community Issues and Discussion
  - win_wua issue. I'll take a look at it.
  - winrepo versions... tagging winrepo versions
    - Create winrepo packages that are installed with Salt Package Manager (SPM)
    - Publish a JSON file with the contents of the repository on a release
    - Create packages using SPM so people don't have to use Git to use winrepo

## TODO
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Twangboy: archive.repo.saltproject.io
  - I need to find out if this is still used and if we need to archive any of
    our more recent releases
- Daffydj: Renovate workshop for next meeting
