  - PR Next week after talking to Alyssa
- Dafydd is working on a workflow/script that will detect releases of software
  and create a PR when it detects a new release
- Need a way to run an installer that is zipped up
  - Would need to unzip, then run the installer
- Looked at the layout of the salt/py3/windows
  - Need to create some symlinks under ``latest`` that say ``latest`` instead of
    the version number

## TODO
Future:
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/53969
  - Let's talk about this in the next core meeting or on slack with the team
  - Bring it up in Open Hour
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
