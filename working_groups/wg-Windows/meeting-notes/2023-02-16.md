- https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/53969
  - We need to maybe add a `mirror` option so that it deletes items that are no
  - longer on the master

## TODO
Future:
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/53969
  - Let's talk about this in the next core meeting or on slack with the team
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Twangboy: Test giving Non-Admin user to registry key
  - This may be working now... needs further testing
  - Need to be able to start the minion as a standard non-privileged user
