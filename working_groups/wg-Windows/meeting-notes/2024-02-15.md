## Discussed Previously
- salt.modules.win_event
  - need to add xmltodict as a requirement to Salt
  - DONE: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/65920
- Lea will follow up about being able to restart the minion service
- Lea got the returner working on master, but needs help tying that in to the
  reactor.
  - Maybe need to configure the returner in the master config
  - Maybe use the `event_return` config option on the master
- Lea has written a blog detailing her exploits writing a reactor and
  configuring it with Salt. Also, how she is using Salt to manage registry
  hives.
- Staffing the Salt Project
  - What does the future hold for Salt-Analytics, Salt-Describe, Salt-Heist, etc
- Unusual uses of Salt
  - Provide notifications (slack/salt-analytics) of things happening on the
    minion. Ability to send to an external monitoring software
    (nagios/elastic/zabbix/datadog/checkmk). Can salt-analytics do that?

## Today's Discussion
- Unusual uses of Salt
  - Provide notifications (slack/salt-analytics) of things happening on the
    minion. Ability to send to an external monitoring software
    (nagios/elastic/zabbix/datadog/checkmk). Can salt-analytics do that?
- xmltodict will be in 3006.7 for Windows
- Master on Windows:
  - $env:SALT_BUILD_ALL_BINS=1
  - pip install -e .
  - salt * test.ping

## TODO
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Twangboy: What's going on with some projects that were managed by former Salt
