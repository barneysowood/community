# Windows Working Group Meeting
# Notes from 2025-01-16

## Attendees
- Shane Lee (@twangboy)
- Dafydd Jones (@dafyddj)

## Agenda
- Welcome
- CICD/AWS Issues
  - Working through getting the pipeline fixed
- Releases:
  - 3006.10 (after the new  year)
  - 3007.2 (after the new year)
  - 3008rc (after the new year)
- Discussed Previously:
  - Semantic Releases
  - Dafydd showed us around the new Semantic releases in winrepo
    - Semantic releases looks for keywords in the commit messages
    - When those are found it triggers a release
    - The type of release (major, minor, patch) is dependent upon the keyword used
    - The release itself also generates a json file for each package in winrepo
      that just contains the versions available for that package. It uses github
      pages and works like an API of sorts. There is currently no index.html, so
      you need to pass a version. Here are some examples.
      https://saltstack.github.io/salt-winrepo-ng/latest/7zip.json
      https://saltstack.github.io/salt-winrepo-ng/v2.0.10/git.json
    - Plans to create an artifact with each release that can be installed onto
      a Salt master or a masterless minion using SPM
    - We're going to investigate if spm works on Windows
- Important Issues:
  -
- Noteable PRs:
  -
- Community Issues and Discussion
  - Bug: WinRepo on Salt 3007.1
    - Has to do with a win_pkg function that doesn't exist
    - Dafydd will continue to try to reproduce
    - We need to have pkg tests for this
  - salt-extensions:
    - Perhaps more adoption/work when 3008rc is released
    - We'll need to see how it works in practice
  - Messaging about CICD
    - We need to have a blog or something outside of Discord to communicate to
      the community why there are no releases, why PRs aren't being merged, etc
  - NSClient Package Definition in WinRepo:
    - Currently it uses the /quiet switch in the installer_flags.
    - Needs to be /qn /noreboot
