## Agenda
- Welcome
- Windows Working Group Board
  - Add a card for NSSM Removal (https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/59148)

## Discussed
- Key rotation
  - This is a security issue. Some security shops require key rotation. Salt
    needs to have a mechanism to do this.
- Problems with Unicode on German Windows, probably any non-English Windows.
  There are issues with returns that contain unicode characters.
- Removing unused libraries from PyWin32. The following seem to be fluff:
  - pythonwin
- Possibly using Rust as a solution to the NSSM problem
- Possibly use https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs and https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3
  to replace PyWin32 since it is maintained by MS
