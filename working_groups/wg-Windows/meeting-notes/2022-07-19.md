## Discussed
- winrepo url tests:
  - Migrate to Windows Runner
  - https://github.com/saltstack/salt-winrepo-ng/blob/master/.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml
  - Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/61789
  - Use one of our installers to set up salt
  - Use the python environment from the installer
  - Use requests instead of pycurl to verify URLs
- salt-minion software definition needs to be fixed
  - It's pointing to ProgramData instead of Program Files
- Making Salt work as a standard user
  - Dafydd has had more success recently running salt as a standard user

## TODO
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Twangboy: Fix the Software Definition for salt-minion
  - Currently pointing to ProgramData for the uninstaller
- Twangboy: Discuss removing pycurl from requirements for Windows
  - It's not being used by any other package (linux, darwin, freebsd)
  - Use requests instead
  - Team wants to NOT remove it... instead we'll need to build it
- Dafydd: Work on transitioning the winrepo tests to run on a Windows Runner
  - Migrating to requests from pycurl in the tests
  - Look into implementing the tests as a salt extension
- Twangboy: Test giving Non-Admin user to registry key
  - This may be working now... needs further testing
  - Need to be able to start the minion as a standard non-privileged user
