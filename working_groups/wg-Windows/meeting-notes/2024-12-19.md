- Noteable PRs:
  - 
- Community Issues and Discussion
  - Semantic Releases
  - Dafydd showed us around the new Semantic releases in winrepo
    - Semantic releases looks for keywords in the commit messages
    - When those are found it triggers a release
    - The type of release (major, minor, patch) is dependent upon the keyword used
    - The release itself also generates a json file for each package in winrepo
      that just contains the versions available for that package. It uses github
      pages and works like an API of sorts. There is currently no index.html, so
      you need to pass a version. Here are some examples.
      https://saltstack.github.io/salt-winrepo-ng/latest/7zip.json
      https://saltstack.github.io/salt-winrepo-ng/v2.0.10/git.json
    - Plans to create an artifact with each release that can be installed onto
      a Salt master or a masterless minion using SPM
    - We're going to investigate if spm works on Windows
