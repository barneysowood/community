## Today's Discussion
- Randy's Issue: https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/65529
  - Need to research fileserver_backend
  - The files are being cached, but the state system can't find them
- Bootstrap Script
  - Seems to be a release behind
- Can't restart the minion service from the Task Manger -> Services tab
  - But it works from the services GUI
- Slack notifications
  - Slack module looks to be out of date
  - Slack no longer uses an API key
  - Instead, you have a web-hook with a unique URL
  - Looked at using other methods to post to the webhook
  - https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/http.html#execution-module
  - Or just using `cmd.run curl` or something

## TODO
- Twangboy: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/15
  - `/move-config` options works from the GUI, but not Silently
  - Move this to Salt repo as the scripts have been moved there
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
  - Move this to Salt repo as the scripts have been moved there
