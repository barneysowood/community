    - Discord Event
- Releases:
  - 3006.10 (upcoming)
  - 3007.2 (upcoming)
- Discussed Previously:
  - Went through adding a renovate comment on Notepad++ and VLC
    After merge, renovate created a PR with the latest version
  - Mark brought up the ability to specify a source in a closed/air-gapped
    environment. We talked about adding some boilerplate code that defaults to
    the original location, but could be changed with a grain or minion config.
    Jinja at the top that defaults to the public source, but lets you specify
    your own from pillar, minion config, or grains. (Firefox uses config.get)
- Important Issues:
  - Reboot state has a hard-coded delay
    - Need to add the `wait_for_reboot` option to the state for `system.reboot`
    - Also needs to be documented to be clear that the wait isn't occurring on
      the master.
    - No issue was created
- Noteable PRs:
  - 
- Community Issues and Discussion
  - Compartmentalizing Pillar Data
    - Shane needs to follow up with Daniel or CR
    - (Asked in open hour)

## Today's Discussion
- Using renovate to get versions from software outside of github

## TODO
- Twangboy: Test: https://github.com/saltstack/salt-windows-nsis/issues/11
  - I'm sure there are tests for this
- Twangboy: archive.repo.saltproject.io
  - I need to find out if this is still used and if we need to archive any of
    our more recent releases
