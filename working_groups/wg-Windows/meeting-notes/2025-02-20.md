## Agenda
- Welcome
- CICD Status
  - Getting close
- Releases:
  - 3006.10 : next week
  - 3007.2  : next week
  - 3008rc  : maybe april
- Discussed Previously:
  - Bug: WinRepo on Salt 3007.1
    - Has to do with a win_pkg function that doesn't exist
    - Dafydd will continue to try to reproduce
    - We need to have pkg tests for this
  - salt-extensions:
    - Perhaps more adoption/work when 3008rc is released
    - We'll need to see how it works in practice
  - Messaging about CICD
    - We need to have a blog or something outside of Discord to communicate to
      the community why there are no releases, why PRs aren't being merged, etc
  - NSClient Package Definition in WinRepo:
    - Currently it uses the /quiet switch in the installer_flags.
    - Needs to be /qn /norestart
- Important Issues:
  - 3007.1 isn't installing in the CICD on WinRepo
    - It regularly times out, had to put a timeout on the job so that it doesn't
      run for hours.
    - It's intermittent
- Noteable PRs:
  -
- Community Issues and Discussion
  - WMIC Grains issue will be released in 3006.10/3007.2
  - OSConfig
    - To make your system conform to security requirements
    - Part of Server 2025
    - There are powershell tools to support this
    - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/osconfig/osconfig-overview
  - win_lgpo
    - You have to run `gpupdate` to apply the policies
    - This would apply to the lgpo_reg module as well
    - Use a requisite (listen) to detect changes to the LGPO and then apply gpupdate

## TODO
- Get the NSIS Installer changes into 3007.x. Figure out how they got missed
  in the merge forward
