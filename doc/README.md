# Doc Generation 

> **NOTE**: _This README can be ignored, as `salt` is no longer a prereq tool to_
> _contribute to this repo._

## How to Generate Docs
* Install Salt.
* Open a terminal with admin privileges. 
* Run `python doc_make.py` in doc directory.

## How to Edit README.md
All of the working groups `"README.md"` data is kept in `"working_groups_raw_data.yaml"`. 
Don't directly modify the Working groups or Homepage `"README.md"`.
Modify the `".yaml"` and then generate the docs.
If the generation of the docs was successfully then push them to the repo.
